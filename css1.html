            <h2>CCS About</h2>
            <h3>What does CSS mean?</h3>
            <p>Tags for formatting a web page were never intended in HTML. HTML was established to define a web page’s content. The addition of tags like (font) and color attributes to HTML created a big problem for web developers. The creation of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to each page, became a time-consuming and costly procedure. CSS was established to address this issue. CSS eliminated the HTML page’s style formatting.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How CSS is different from HTML?</h3>
            <p>- HTML is used to define a structure of a web page whereas CSS is used to style the web pages by using different styling features.</p>
            <p>- HTML consists of tags inside which text is enclosed and CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks.</p>
            <p>- CSS can be internal or external depending upon the requirement.</p>
            <p>- We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet but we can use CSS inside an HTML document.</p>
            <p>- CSS has comparatively higher backup and support than HTML.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why is CSS used in HTML?</h3>
            <p><b>Solves a big problem: </b>Font, color, background style, element alignments, border, and size tags had to be duplicated on each web page before CSS. This was a lengthy procedure.</p>
            <p><b>Saves a lot of time: </b>Because CSS style definitions are stored in external CSS files, updating only one file can modify the entire website.</p>
            <p><b>Provide more attributes: </b>CSS gives more specific features for defining the look and feel of a website than simple HTML.</p>
            <p><b>Pages load faster:</b>CSS doesn’t require you to write HTML tag attributes all of the time. A tag’s rule can be written once and applied to all instances of the tag. As a result, CSS uses less code, resulting in speedier download times.</p>
            <p><b>Easier Website maintenance: </b>CSS makes website maintenance much easier. If we need to make a global change to the file, we can simply alter the style, which will update all of the elements on the web page.</p>
            <p><b>Multiple device compatibility: </b>We can use CSS with older language versions because it is compatible with them. CSS makes it possible to optimize material for several devices.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why we learn CSS?</h3>
            <p>Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.</p>
            <p><b>Base for web development: </b>HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer should know. It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.</p>
            <p><b>Makes your website look attractive: </b>A website that’s dull and plain will not attract the user most probably, so adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.</p>
            <p><b>Makes the design come live: </b>A web developer is responsible for making the design given to him as a live product. It is used for styling to develop the design of the website.</p>
            <p><b>Increases user experience of the website: </b>A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would help the users to go through the website easily. It is used to make the user interface better.</p>
            <p><b>More career opportunities: </b>Since CSS is a basic requirement while learning Web Development, therefor there are abundant career opportunities for it. As a freelancer, you can land up to many projects.</p>
